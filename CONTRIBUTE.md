# Contributing
The Open Source Morning Project is a project open to anyone to contribute to.

## What is this App going to be
In the end we would love this app to be more than just another weather app. We would like this to have headlining stories, stock market data, traffic updates and so much more. This may be reminding you of Android's news page when you swipe left from your home screen.

## Guidelines
Prior to contributing check out our [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Open-Source-Morning-Project-ea81479be2ca4bc98989ff11901e1e3e) page to see if your feature or fix is currently being worked on. Also check the Files page to see if your current file is being modified. Try your best to make new files instead of editing current ones.

If there is a feature/bug already labeled in our Notion that you would like to work on, you may do so. Contact one of the project founders when you start so we can update the status.

## Contribute
1. Fork it
2. Ensure you have a MongoDB server to play with (see example.json for a sample document)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a PR

If you have any questions you may contact any one of the three founders on Discord (see README)
